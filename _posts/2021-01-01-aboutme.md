<p style="font-size:14px;">
I obtained a Ph.D. (2022) at KAIST, South Korea. I was a member of the <a href="https://rpm.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank"> IRAP lab</a> (currently moved to RPM Robotics Lab, SNU), and advised by Prof. <a href="https://ayoungk.github.io/" target="_blank"> Ayoung Kim</a>.

My main research topic during the Ph.D. had been focused on <a href="https://bit.ly/3HbkjEH" target="_blank">robust 3D mapping in complex urban sites using LiDAR sensors</a>. I have experience with a full pipeline of robot state estimation in real-world (from 3D perception, sensor fusion, calibration, odometry, place retrieval, pose-graph optimization, multi-session localization, to long-term map management).

My current position is a research scientist at NAVER LABS. I am conducting research on robust and scalable localization and mapping of autonomous vehicles in a complex city.
