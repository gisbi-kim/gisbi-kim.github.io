<p style="font-size:14px;">
I obtained a Ph.D. (2022) at KAIST, South Korea. I was a member of the IRAP lab (currently moved to <a href="https://rpm.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">RPM Robotics Lab</a>, SNU), and advised by Prof. <a href="https://ayoungk.github.io/" target="_blank"> Ayoung Kim</a>.

<p style="font-size:14px;">
My research topic during Ph.D. had been focused on <a href="https://bit.ly/3HbkjEH" target="_blank">LiDAR-based robust 3D mapping in complex urban sites</a>. I have experience with a full pipeline of robotic localization and mapping in real-world (from 3D perception, sensor fusion, calibration, odometry, place recognition, pose-graph optimization, multi-session localization, to long-term map management).

I am currently a research engineer at <a href="https://www.naverlabs.com/" target="_blank">NAVER LABS</a>. I'm focusing on developing robust and scalable localization and mapping of autonomous vehicles in a complex city.
