<p style="font-size:14px;">
I am a Ph.D. student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I am a member of the <a href="https://irap.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank"> IRAP lab </a>, where I'm advised by Prof. <a href="https://irap.kaist.ac.kr/~ayoung/" target="_blank"> Ayoung Kim</a>.

My main research topic during the Ph.D. has been focused on robust 3D mapping in complex urban sites using LiDAR sensors. To do so, I have interests in all mobile robot-related topics and spatial AI including from 3D perception, sensor fusion, and SLAM to deep learning.

I have experience with a full pipeline of SLAM in the real-world (i.e., from sensor fusion, calibration, odometry, place retrieval, pose-graph optimization, multi-session localization, to long-term map management).
